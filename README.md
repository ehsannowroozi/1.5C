### Training 1.5C

#### 1. Choice of Feature set,
   
   With regard to the choice of the feature set, the features have to be powerful enough to capture the different types of 
dependencies among neighboring pixels in the pristine and manipulated images. Also, we want to keep the dimensionality of
the feature set limited, so to make it possible to design the intermediate and combination classifiers as SVMs, without
resorting to more complicated architecture such as ensemble classifiers. Specifically, we selected the [Subtractive Pixel
Adjacency Model (SPAM)](http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/feature_extractors/download/spam686.m) feature set, which extensively used in image forensic applications. In Fact, SPAM features are designed for grayscale images; when working with color images, they can be extracted from the luminance channel. You can find the whole code in the folder "FeatureComputation". Also, You need to run only the code "FeatureComputation.m"

Please see the section of 3.2 regarding implementation of 1.5C and Choice of the Feature Set.
